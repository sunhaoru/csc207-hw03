For this assignment, our biggest roadblock was working on almost the entire the project with half of the partnership working remotely due to contagion. However, we worked through one at a time. Part D caused a bit of trouble, mostly with merge. Part D also often required edits to Part C for ease or feasibility. Finally, we added documentation and considered the code complete.
